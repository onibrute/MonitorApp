# âš¡ MonitorApp â€“ Real-Time Industrial Current Monitoring

MonitorApp is a Windows desktop application developed in C++ using MFC, designed to monitor analog current from up to 4 industrial input channels in real time.  
Built around the MODBUS RTU protocol and serial communication (RS-485), it interfaces with ICP DAS modules (I-7017RC and I-7024L) through isolated RS-232/RS-485 converters (I-7520R).

This project was developed as a Bachelorâ€™s thesis in Automation and Applied Informatics and integrates hardware communication, protocol implementation, graphical monitoring, and alerting in a single unified application.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Monitor real-time electrical current values from industrial modules
- Build a full MFC GUI for visualization, logging, and control
- Implement MODBUS RTU communication from scratch (without external libraries)
- Support calibration, error simulation, and alarm thresholds
- Enable full operation with or without physical hardware (simulation mode)

## ðŸ›  Hardware Architecture

- **I-7017RC**: Analog input module (4 current channels, 4â€“20 mA)
- **I-7024L**: Analog output module (0â€“10V via DCON)
- **I-7520R**: RS-232 â†” RS-485 isolated converters
- **PC**: Connects to both modules on separate COM ports

Each path is fully independent:
- Acquisition: `PC â†” RS232 â†” I-7520R â†” I-7017RC (MODBUS RTU)`
- Generation: `PC â†” RS232 â†” I-7520R â†” I-7024L (DCON Utility)`
